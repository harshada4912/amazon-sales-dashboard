#Amazon Sales Dashboard

The Amazon Sales Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool designed to analyze and monitor sales performance on the Amazon marketplace. It provides key insights into sales trends, revenue growth, profit margins, and customer behavior through dynamic charts and KPIs.
The dashboard enables users (such as sellers, managers, or analysts) to make data-driven decisions by tracking the performance of products, categories, and regions over time.
